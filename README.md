# Wordpress installer

The idea of this project, is to build an installer ala the Laravel installer: `laravel new PROJECT_NAME`

The package will be used in the same fashion: `wordpress new PROJECT_NAME`.  
I'm considering adding a function to run the Wordpress setup through the console, after you've created the project.
